# String Calculator — TDD Kata (Flutter / Dart)

This repository contains an implementation of the classic **String Calculator Kata**, built using **pure Dart logic** inside a Flutter project while strictly following **Test Driven Development (TDD)** best practices.

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate incremental design, disciplined testing, and safe refactoring — not UI development.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Make sure Flutter is installed, then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
