# String Calculator — TDD Kata (Flutter / Dart)

This repository contains an implementation of the classic **String Calculator Kata**, built using **pure Dart logic** inside a Flutter project, strictly following **Test Driven Development (TDD)** best practices.

The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate incremental design, disciplined testing, and safe refactoring — not UI.


## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Ensure Flutter is installed, then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test


## 💡 Key Notes

- No UI used — logic only
- Designed strictly via TDD
- Clean and readable test cases
- Incremental Git commits to reflect development steps
- Flutter used purely as a Dart execution environment
